### Custom Transformer-Based LLM for Text Summarization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a custom Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch to perform text summarization. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on pre-trained models, this project focuses on building the Transformer architecture, training the model, and evaluating its summarization capabilities.

## 📂 Dataset

The model is trained using a public text summarization dataset, which can be accessed at:🔗 Kaggle Dataset

## 🔧 Features & Methodology

# 1️⃣ Building the Transformer Model

Implemented the Transformer architecture from scratch

Includes encoder-decoder, multi-head attention, positional encoding

Custom modifications such as hierarchical attention, dropout, and layer normalization for optimization

# 2️⃣ Summarization Techniques

Supports both extractive and abstractive summarization

Uses self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships

# 3️⃣ Training & Optimization

Optimizer: Adam, AdamW

Loss Function: Cross-entropy for sequence-to-sequence learning

Regularization: Dropout, early stopping, learning rate scheduling

# 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

ROUGE Scores (ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L) for summary quality assessment

Manual Evaluation: Relevance, coherence, conciseness

# 5️⃣ Performance Analysis

Compares results with standard models (e.g., GPT-2, BERT-based summarizers)

Analyzes training loss and ROUGE score improvements

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

PyTorch / TensorFlow

NumPy, Pandas

Transformers (Hugging Face)

NLTK / SpaCy (for text processing)


## Steps to Run:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AbsarRaashid3/Designing a Custom Transformer-Based LLM for Text Summarization.git
cd your-repo-name

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
